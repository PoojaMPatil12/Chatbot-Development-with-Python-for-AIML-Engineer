The project integrates DeepSeek's R1 model using Ollama to create a PDF-interactive chatbot. Users can upload a PDF and pose questions, to which the chatbot responds based on the document's content. The system extracts text from the PDF, processes it with the R1 model via Ollama, and delivers concise answers. This setup offers a cost-effective and efficient solution for document-based queries, leveraging the advanced reasoning capabilities of DeepSeek's R1 model.
